# Honors Thesis in Quantitative Social Science


This repository includes all data and R files pertaining to my senior thesis. The purpose of this thesis was to explore the relationship between colonialism and civil war using binomial logistic regression. 


The following is the abstract of the paper: 

What causes civil war?  The study of civil war is full of conflicting research that arguesfor or against different variables that determine intra-state conflict.  Such variables include GDP,  natural  resources,  institutions,  racial  differences  among  many  others.   Since  WorldWar II, there have been many civil wars in new countries that gained independence afterthe war.  This study attempts to find if there is a link between colonialism and post-colonialcivil war and finds that extractive colonialism is correlated with increased odds of civil warwhile settler colonialism has no link.
